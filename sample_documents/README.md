About Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes 
by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning 
(the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning 
(using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions) and self-correction.

Key AI Technologies:
- Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Robotics
- Expert Systems

Applications of AI include:
1. Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa)
2. Recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon)
3. Autonomous vehicles
4. Medical diagnosis
5. Financial trading

The field of AI has seen significant growth in recent years due to advances 
in computing power, availability of large datasets, and improved algorithms.
